Phase 1 Writeup for Group 8:
Group Members: Harry Weinstock, Ryan Trotter, Ankith Suhas Pinnamaneni

1. Additional Tasks we would like graded: 1.7, 1.8, 1.9

2. Changes made to the code:
  1.1: 
  1.2: 
  1.3: 
  1.7: Changed code in UserInterface.start and UserInterface.createFund so that only valid input is accepted. In start, the user is only able to enter an integer that falls between 0 and the number of funds available. In createFund, for the fund target, the user is only able to enter a positive integer above 0. If anything else is entered, the user is repeatedly prompted to re-enter a valid input. 
  1.8: Changed the if...else statement in DataManager.attemptLogin to include a condition for when login fails due to incorrect username/password. Also, made the method throw an exception when there's a server connection error. This error is then caught and thrown again to be handled in UserInterface.main. 
  1.9: 

3. and 4. Bugs Found:
